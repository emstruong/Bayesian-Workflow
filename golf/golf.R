#' # Data
#' 
#' The following graph shows data from professional golfers on the proportion of successful
#' putts as a function of distance from the hole [from @Berry:1995].  Unsurprisingly, the
#' probability of making the shot declines as a function of distance:
golf <- read.table(root("golf", "data", "golf_data.txt"), 
                   header = TRUE, skip = 2)
x <- golf$x
y <- golf$y
n <- golf$n
J <- length(y)
r <- (1.68 / 2) / 12
R <- (4.25 / 2) / 12
se <- sqrt((y / n) * (1 - y / n) / n)

     xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", bty = "l", 
     xlab = "Distance from hole (feet)", 
     ylab = "Probability of success", 
     main = "Data on putts in pro golf",

     y / n + se + .02,
     paste(y, "/", n, sep = ""),
     cex = .6,
     col = "gray40")

#' The error bars associated with each point $j$ in the above graph are
#' simple classical standard deviations,
#' $\sqrt{\hat{p}_j(1-\hat{p}_j)/n_j}$, where $\hat{p}_j=y_j/n_j$ is the
#' success rate for putts taken at distance $x_j$.
#'
#' # Logistic regression
#'
#' Can we model the probability of success in golf putting as a function
#' of distance from the hole?  Given usual statistical practice, the
#' natural starting point would be logistic regression:
#'
#' $$
#' y_j\sim\mathrm{binomial}(n_j, \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(a + bx_j)),
#' \text{ for } j=1,\dots, J.
#' $$
#' In Stan, this is:
#| results: asis
print_stan_file(root("golf", "golf_logistic.stan"))

#' The code in the above model block is (implicitly) vectorized, so
#' that it is mathematically equivalent to modeling each data point,
#' `y[i] ~ binomial_logit(n[i], a + b*x[i])`.  The vectorized code is
#' more compact (no need to write a loop, or to include the
#' subscripts) and faster (because of more efficient gradient
#' evaluations).
#'
#' We fit the model to the data:
#| label: golf_logistic.stan
#| results: hide
golf_data <- list(x = x, y = y, n = n, J = J)
model_1 <- cmdstan_model(root("golf", "golf_logistic.stan"))
fit_1 <- model_1$sample(data = golf_data, refresh = 0)

#' And here is the result:
draws_1 <- fit_1$draws(format = "df")
a_sim <- draws_1$a
b_sim <- draws_1$b
a_hat <- mean(a_sim)
b_hat <- mean(b_sim)
n_sims <- nrow(draws_1)
print(fit_1)

#' Going through the columns of the above table: Stan has computed the
#' posterior means $\pm$ standard deviations of $a$ and $b$ to be
#' `{r} sprintf("%.2f", mean(a_sim))` $\pm$ `{r} sprintf("%.2f", sd(a_sim))`
#' and `{r} sprintf("%.2f", mean(b_sim))` $\pm$ `{r} sprintf("%.2f", sd(b_sim))`,
#' respectively. The Monte Carlo standard error of the mean of each of
#' these parameters is 0 (to two decimal places), indicating that the
#' simulations have run long enough to estimate the posterior means
#' precisely.  The posterior quantiles give a sense of the uncertainty
#' in the parameters, with 50% posterior intervals of
#' [`{r} sprintf("%.2f", quantile(a_sim, 0.25))`,
#' `{r} sprintf("%.2f", quantile(a_sim, 0.75))`] and
#' [`{r} sprintf("%.2f", quantile(b_sim, 0.25))`,
#' `{r} sprintf("%.2f", quantile(b_sim, 0.75))`] for $a$ and $b$, respectively.
#' Finally, the values of $\widehat{R}$ near 1 tell us that the
#' simulations from Stan's four simulated chains have mixed well.

#' The black line shows the fit corresponding to the posterior median
#' estimates of the parameters $a$ and $b$; the green lines show 10 draws

#'
#' In this example, posterior uncertainties in the fits are small, and
#' for simplicity we will just plot point estimates based on posterior
#' median parameter estimates for the remaining models.  Our focus
#' here is on the sequence of models that we fit, not so much on
#' uncertainty in particular model fits.
#'
#' # Modeling from first principles
#'
#' As an alternative to logistic regression, we shall build a model from
#' first principles and fit it to the data.
#'
#' The graph below shows a simplified sketch of a golf shot.  The
#' dotted line represents the angle within which the ball of radius
#' $r$ must be hit so that it falls within the hole of radius $R$.
#' This threshold angle is $\sin^{-1}((R-r)/x)$.  The graph, which is
#' not to scale, is intended to illustrate the geometry of the ball
#' needing to go into the hole.

#' The next step is to model human error.  We assume that the golfer is
#' attempting to hit the ball completely straight but that many small
#' factors interfere with this goal, so that the actual angle follows a
#' normal distribution centered at 0 with some standard deviation
#' $\sigma$.

#' The probability the ball goes in the hole is then the probability

#' 2\Phi\left(\frac{\sin^{-1}((R-r)/x)}{\sigma}\right) - 1$, where
#' $\Phi$ is the cumulative normal distribution function.  The only
#' unknown parameter in this model is $\sigma$, the standard deviation
#' of the distribution of shot angles. Stan (and, for that matter, R)
#' computes trigonometry using angles in radians, so at the end of our
#' calculations we will need to multiply by $180/\pi$ to convert to
#' degrees, which are more interpretable by humans.
#' 
#' Our model then has two parts:
#' \begin{align}
#' y_j &\sim \mathrm{binomial}(n_j, p_j)\\
#' p_j &= 2\Phi\left(\frac{\sin^{-1}((R-r)/x_j)}{\sigma}\right) - 1 , \text{ for } j=1,\dots, J.
#' \end{align}

#' The highest curve on the graph corresponds to $\sigma=0.5^\circ$:
#' if golfers could control the angles of their putts to an accuracy
#' of approximately half a degree, they would have a very high
#' probability of success, making over 80\% of their ten-foot putts,
#' over 50\% of their fifteen-foot putts, and so on.  At the other
#' extreme, the lowest plotted curve corresponds to $\sigma=20^\circ$:
#' if your putts could be off as high as 20 degrees, then you would be
#' highly inaccurate, missing more than half of your two-foot
#' putts. When fitting the model in Stan, the program moves around the
#' space of $\sigma$, sampling from the posterior distribution.

#' In the transformed data block above, the `./` in the calculation of
#' p corresponds to componentwise division in this vectorized
#' computation.
#' 
#' The data $J,n,x,y$ have already been set up; we just need to define
#' $r$ and $R$ (the golf ball and hole have diameters 1.68 and 4.25
#' inches, respectively), and run the Stan model:

draws_2 <- fit_2$draws(format = "df")
sigma_sim <- draws_2$sigma
sigma_degrees_sim <- draws_2$sigma_degrees
sigma_hat <- mean(sigma_sim)
print(fit_2)

#' The model has a single parameter, $\sigma$.  From the output, we
#' find that Stan has computed the posterior mean of $\sigma$ to be 
#' `{r} sprintf("%.2f", mean(sigma_sim))`.  Multiplying this by $180/\pi$,
#' this comes to `{r} sprintf("%.2f", mean(sigma_degrees_sim))` degrees.
#' The Monte Carlo standard error of the mean is 0 (to two decimal
#' places), indicating that the simulations have run long enough to
#' estimate the posterior mean precisely.  The posterior standard
#' deviation is calculated at `{r} sprintf("%.2f",
#' sd(sigma_degrees_sim))` degrees, indicating that $\sigma$ itself
#' has been estimated with high precision, which makes sense given the
#' large number of data points and the simplicity of the model.  The
#' precise posterior distribution of $\sigma$ can also be seen from
#' the narrow range of the posterior quantiles.  Finally,
#' $\widehat{R}$ is near 1, telling us that the simulations from
#' Stan's four simulated chains have mixed well.
#'
#' We next plot the data and the fitted model (here using the
#' posterior median of $\sigma$ but in this case the uncertainty is so
#' narrow that any reasonable posterior summary would give essentially
#' the same result), along with the logistic regression fitted

#' that the angle is not the only factor determining whether the ball
#' goes in the hole---but it seems like a useful start.
#'
#' # Testing the fitted model on new data
#'
#' Several years after fitting the above model, we were presented with
#' a newer and more comprehensive dataset on professional golf putting
#' [@Broadie:2018].  For simplicity we'll just look here at the
#' summary data, probabilities of the ball going into the hole for
#' shots up to 75 feet from the hole.  The graph below shows these new

#' Comparing the two datasets in the range 0-20 feet, the success rate
#' is similar for longer putts but is much higher than before for the
#' short putts. This could be a measurement issue, if the distances to
#' the hole are only approximate for the old data, and it could also
#' be that golfers are better than they used to be.
#'
#' Beyond 20 feet, the empirical success rates become lower than would
#' be predicted by the old model. These are much more difficult
#' attempts, even after accounting for the increased angular precision
#' required as distance goes up.  In addition, the new data look
#' smoother, which perhaps is a reflection of more comprehensive data
#' collection.
#'
#' # A new model accounting for how hard the ball is hit
#'
#' To get the ball in the hole, the angle isn’t the only thing you
#' need to control; you also need to hit the ball just hard enough.
#'
#' @Broadie:2018 added this feature to the geometric model by
#' introducing another parameter corresponding to the golfer's control
#' over distance. Supposing $u$ is the distance that golfer's shot
#' would travel if there were no hole, the assumption is that the putt
#' will go in if (a) the angle allows the ball to go over the hole,
#' and (b) $u$ is in the range $(x,x+3)$. That is the ball must be hit
#' hard enough to reach the whole but not go too far. Factor (a) is
#' what we have considered earlier; we must now add factor (b).
#'
#' The following sketch, which is not to scale, illustrates the need
#' for the distance as angle as well as the angle of the shot to be in
#' some range, in this case the gray zone which represents the
#' trajectories for which the ball would reach the hole and stay in
#' it.

#' Suppose that a golfer will aim to hit the ball one foot past the
#' hole but with a multiplicative error in the shot's potential
#' distance, so that $u=(x+1)(1+\epsilon)$, where the error $\epsilon$
#' has a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation
#' $\sigma_{\rm distance}$. In statistics notation, this model is,
#' $u\sim\normal(x+1,(x+1)\sigma_{\rm distance})$, and the distance is
#' acceptable if $u\in [x,x+3]$, an event that has probability
#' $\Phi\left(\frac{2}{(x+1)\sigma_{\rm distance}}\right)-\Phi\left(\frac{-1}{(x+1)\sigma_{\rm distance}}\right).$
#'
#' Putting these together, the probability a shot goes in becomes,
#' $\left(2\Phi\left(\frac{\sin^{-1}((R-r)/x)}{\sigma_{\rm
#' angle}}\right) -
#' 1\right)\left(\Phi\left(\frac{2}{(x+1)\,\sigma_{\rm
#' distance}}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{-1}{(x+1)\,\sigma_{\rm
#' distance}}\right)\right)$, where we have renamed the parameter
#' $\sigma$ from our earlier model to $\sigma_{\rm angle}$ to
#' distinguish it from the new $\sigma_{\rm distance}$ parameter.  We
#' write the new model in Stan, giving it the name
#' `golf_angle_distance_binomial.stan` to convey that it accounts both
#' for angle and distance:
#| results: asis
print_stan_file(root("golf", "golf_angle_distance_binomial.stan"))

#' The result is a model with two parameters, $\sigma_{\rm angle}$ and
#' $\sigma_{\rm distance}$. Even this improved geometry-based model is
#' a gross oversimplification of putting, and the average distances in
#' the binned data are not the exact distances for each shot.  But it
#' should be an advance on the earlier one-parameter model; the next
#' step is to see how it fits the data.
#'
#' Here we have defined `overshot` and `distance_tolerance` as data,
#' which @Broadie:2018 has specified as 1 and 3 feet, respectively.
#' We might wonder why if the distance range is 3 feet, the overshot
#' is not 1.5 feet. One reason could be that it is riskier to hit the
#' ball too hard than too soft.  In addition we assigned weakly
#' informative half-normal(0,1) priors on the scale parameters,
#' $\sigma_{\rm angle}$ and $\sigma_{\rm distance}$, which are
#' required in this case to keep the computations stable.
#'
#' We fit the model to the new dataset.

#' There are problems with the fit in the middle of the range of $x$.
#' We suspect this is a problem with the binomial error model, as it
#' tries harder to fit points where the counts are higher.  Look at
#' how closely the fitted curve hugs the data at the very lowest
#' values of $x$.
#'
#' Here are the first few rows of the data:
print(golf_new[1:5,])

#' With such large values of $n_j$, the likelihood enforces
#' an extremely close fit at these first few points, and that drives
#' the entire fit of the model.
#'
#' # Expanding the model by including a fudge factor
#' 
#' To fix this problem we took the data model, $y_j \sim
#' \mathrm{binomial}(n_j, p_j)$, and added an independent error term to
#' each observation.  There is no easy way to add error directly to
#' the binomial distribution---we could replace it with its
#' overdispersed generalization, the beta-binomial, but this would not
#' be appropriate here because the variance for each data point $i$
#' would still be roughly proportional to the sample size $n_j$, and
#' our whole point here is to get away from this assumption and allow
#' for model misspecification---so instead we first approximate the
#' binomial data distribution by a normal and then add independent
#' variance; thus: $$y_j/n_j \sim \mathrm{normal}\left(p_j,
#' \sqrt{p_j(1-p_j)/n_j + \sigma_y^2}\right),$$ To write this in Stan
#' there are some complications:
#'
#' * $y$ and $n$ are integer variables, which we convert to vectors so
#'   that we can multiply and divide them.
#'
#' * To perform componentwise multiplication or division using
#'   vectors, you need to use `.*` or `./` so that San knows not to
#'   try to perform vector/matrix multiplication and division.  Stan
#'   is opposite from R in this way: Stan defaults to vector/matrix
#'   operations and has to be told otherwise, whereas R defaults to
#'   componentwise operations, and vector/matrix multiplication in R
#'   is indicated using the `%*%` operator.
#'
#' We implement these via the following new code in the transformed data block:
#' ```stan
#'   vector[J] raw_proportions = to_vector(y) ./ to_vector(n);
#' ```
#' And then in the model block:
#' ```stan
#'   raw_proportions ~ normal(p, sqrt(p .* (1-p) ./ to_vector(n) + sigma_y^2));
#' ```
#'
#' To complete the model we add $\sigma_y$ to the parameters block and
#' assign it a weakly informative half-normal(0,1) prior
#' distribution. Here's the new Stan program:

#'   putts taken by pro golfers.  The estimate of $\sigma_{\rm angle}$
#'   has decreased compared to the earlier model that only had angular
#'   errors.  This makes sense: now that distance errors have been
#'   included in the model, there is no need to explain so many of the
#'   missed shots using errors in angle.
#'
#' * $\sigma_{\rm distance}$ is estimated at `{r} sprintf("%.2f",
