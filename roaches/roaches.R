#' # Data
#' 
#' The roaches data example comes from Chapter 8.3 of @Gelman-Hill:2007.
#' 
#' > the treatment and control were applied to 160 and 104 apartments,
#' respectively, and the outcome measurement $y_i$ in each apartment
#' $i$ was the number of roaches caught in a set of traps. Different
#' apartments had traps for different numbers of days
#' 
#' In addition to an intercept, the regression predictors for the
#' model are the pre-treatment number of roaches `roach1`, the
#' treatment indicator `treatment`, and a variable indicating whether
#' the apartment is in a building restricted to elderly residents
#' `senior`. The distribution of `roach1` is very skewed and we take a
#' square root of it. Because the number of days for which the roach
#' traps were used is not the same for all apartments in the sample,
#' we include it as an `exposure2` by adding $\ln(u_i)$) to the linear
#' predictor $\eta_i$ and it can be specified using the `offset`
#' argument in `brms`.
#' 
#' Load data
data(roaches, package = "rstanarm")
roaches$sqrt_roach1 <- sqrt(roaches$roach1)
head(roaches) |> print(digits = 2)

fit_p <- brm(y ~ sqrt_roach1 + treatment + senior + offset(log(exposure2)),
             data = roaches,
             family = poisson,
             prior = prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
             refresh = 0)

#' 
#' All marginal posteriors are clearly away from zero. We need to do
#' some model checking before trusting these.
#' 
#' ## Posterior predictive checking
#' 
#' Posterior predictive checking can often detect problems and also
#' provide more information about the reason. As the range of counts
#' is large, we can use kernel density estimate plot
#' [@Sailynoja-Johnson-Martin-etal:2025].

  theme(legend.position = "inside",
        legend.position.inside = c(0.8, 0.8))

#' We see that the marginal distribution of model replicated data is
#' clearly different from the observed data which are more
#' dispersed. Posterior predictive checking can sometimes have
#' significant bias due to double use of the data, but in this case
#' the discrepancy is so big that further checks are not needed.
#' 
#' Although in this case the model misspecification is obvious with
#' kernel density plot, too, for count the often a better choice is a
#' rootogram variant proposed by @Sailynoja-Johnson-Martin-etal:2025.

#'
#' ## Cross-validation model comparison
#'
#' For demonstration, we show what would happen in cross validation
#' based model comparison if we would ignore posterior predictive
#' checking result.
#' 
#' We use Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out (PSIS-LOO)
#' cross-validation [@Vehtari+etal:PSIS-LOO:2017] as it is very fast to compute.
fit_p <- add_criterion(fit_p, criterion = "loo")
# store the result for later use
loo_p1 <- loo(fit_p)

#' We get warning about high Pareto-$\hat{k}$'s in PSIS-LOO
#' computation and recompute using moment matching
#' [@Paananen+etal:2021:implicit] which translates and scales the
#' posterior draws to better match the moments of the leave-one-out
#' posteriors (done only for the folds with high Pareto-$\hat{k}$)
fit_p <- add_criterion(
  fit_p,
  criterion = "loo",
  moment_match = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)

#' Now all Pareto-$\hat{k}$'s are ok, and we examine LOO results.
loo(fit_p)

#' `p_loo` is about 278, which is much higher than the number of
#' parameters (4), which indicates bad misspecification, which we did
#' already see also with posterior predictive checking. Many high
#' Pareto-\(\hat{k}\)'s in PSIS-LOO without moment matching were
#' likely also caused by model misspecification.
#' 
#' For demonstration, we show what would happen if we would try to use cross validation
#' based model comparison to assess predictive relevance of the covariates. We later
#' compare these to results when using better models.
#'
#' We form 3 models by dropping each of the covariates out at a time.

fit_p_m3 <- update(fit_p, formula = y ~ sqrt_roach1 + treatment) |>
  add_criterion(criterion = "loo", moment_match = TRUE)

#' 
#' Moment matching is able to assist PSIS-LOO computation and all
#' Pareto $\hat{k}$ values are good.
loo_compare(fit_p, fit_p_m1, fit_p_m2, fit_p_m3,
            model_names = c("Poisson full model",
                            "Poisson w/o sqrt(roach1)",
                            "Poisson w/o treatment",
                            "Poisson w/o senior"))

#' Based on `elpd_diff` and `se_diff` the roaches covariate would be
#' relevant, but although dropping treatment or senior covariate will
#' make a large change to elpd, the uncertainty is also very large and
#' cross-validation indicates that these covariates are not
#' necessarily relevant. The posterior marginals are conditional on
#' the model, but cross-validation is more cautious by not using any
#' model for the future data distribution. The column `p_worse`
#' provides a normal approximation base probability that the model is
#' worse than the model with the best performance. The column
#' `diag_diff` indicates that the distributions of the pointwise
#' performance differences are likely to have so thick tails that the
#' normal approximation based on `elpd_diff` and `diff_se` is not well
#' calibrated, and we can't trust the `p_worse` values.  In this case,
#' the thick tails in the pointwise performance differences are likely
#' due to Poisson model being underdispersed compared to the data.
#' 
#' 
#' # Negative binomial model
#' 
#' We change the Poisson model to a more robust negative binomial
#' model. Often it would be sensible to start with negative binomial
#' model for counts and skip the Poisson model.  The negative-binomial
#' shape parameter has the `brms` default prior, which is
#' inverse-gamma$(.4, .3)$ [@Vehtari:2024].

#' 
#' Treatment effect is much closer to zero, and senior effect has lot
#' of probability mass on both sides of 0. So it matters, which model
#' we use, and we should trust posteriors only if the model passes
#' predictive checking.
#' 
#' 
#' ## Posterior and LOO predictive checking
#' 
#' We use posterior predictive checking to compare marginal data and
#' predictive distributions.

  theme(legend.position = "inside",
        legend.position.inside = c(0.8, 0.8))

#' We see that the negative-binomial model is much better although it
#' seems that the model predictive distribution has more mass for
#' small counts than the real data. This discrepancy can also be an
#' artifact from the kernel density estimate, and it is better to
#' examine discrete rootogram

#| out-width: 100%

  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 400)) +
  theme(legend.position = "inside",
        legend.position.inside = c(0.8, 0.8))

#' We see that the negative-binomial model is quite good, and there is
#' no clear discrepancy based on the predictive intervals and data.
#'
#' Instead of looking at the marginal distribution, we can look at the
#' pointwise predictive distribution and corresponding observations.
#| label: fig-ppc_intervals-nb
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
pp_check(fit_nb, "intervals") +
  scale_y_sqrt() +
  theme(legend.position = "inside",
        legend.position.inside = c(0.9, 0.9))

#'
#' If the model predictive distributions are well calibrated, then the
#' observations should look like randomly drawn from the predictive
#' distributions. We can use a `pit_ecdf` to make probability integral
#' transformation (PIT) plot to make the comparison of pointwise
#' posterior predictive distributions and data. One PIT value is the
#' cumulative density of one observation given the corresponding
#' conditional predictive distribution. If the pointwise predictive
#' distributions are well calibrated, PIT values are (almost)
#' uniformly distributed. PIT-ECDF plot compares observed PIT values
#' to uniform distribution.
#| label: fig-ppc_pit-nb
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 5
pp_check(fit_nb, type = "pit_ecdf", method = "correlated")

#' Now that posterior predictive check looks quite good, it is useful
#' to be more careful and use LOO predictive checking, too. We first
#' run PSIS-LOO computation to check it works.
fit_nb <- add_criterion(fit_nb, criterion = "loo")
# store the result for later use
loo_nb1 <- loo(fit_nb)

#' We get warning about high Pareto-$\hat{k}$ and to improve
#' computation accuracy, we re-run with moment matching. We later need
#' some Pareto smoothed importance sampling intermediate computation
#' results and save them, too.
fit_nb <- add_criterion(
  fit_nb,
  criterion = "loo",
  moment_match = TRUE,
  save_psis = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)

#' Let's look at the LOO results.
(loo_nb <- loo(fit_nb))

#' All Pareto-$\hat{k}$ are good indicating PSIS-LOO computation with
#' moment matching works well.  `p_loo` is closer to the actual number
#' of parameters, but still slightly larger than the total number of
#' parameters 5 which is slightly suspicious. `p_loo` is small
#' compared to the number of observations and we may expect pointwise
#' LOO predictive intervals to be similar to pointwise posterior
#' predictive intervals, and LOO-PIT-ECDF to look similar to posterior
#' PIT-ECDF. Although we had used moment matching above, some
#' intermediate results are not stored as they may take a lot of
#' memory, and we use moment matching argument again when computing
#' LOO intervals and LOO-PIT's.  
#| label: fig-ppc_loo_intervals-nb

pp_check(fit_nb, "loo_intervals", moment_match = TRUE) +

#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 5
pp_check(fit_nb, type = "loo_pit_ecdf", moment_match = TRUE,
         method = "correlated")

#' As we guessed, there is not much difference between LOO and
#' posterior intervals, and LOO-PIT-ECDF and PIT-ECDF.
#'
loo_compare(fit_p, fit_nb, model_names = c("Poisson", "Neg-bin"))

#' In LOO model comparison the negative binomial model is much better
#' than the Poisson model. The diagnostic `diag_diff` indicates the
#' pointwise performance differences are likely to have thick tails,
#' which is again likely due to the Poisson model being
#' underdispersed. As we have made the model checking, we know that
#' the Poisson model is misspecified and could be dropped just based
#' on that fact. As the difference is very big and many times bigger
#' than `diff_se`, we can also be certain that negative binomials
#' model has better predictive performance.
#'
#' The next comparison shows the result without moment matching
#' improved computation.
loo_compare(list(`Poisson` = loo_p1, `Neg-bin` = loo_nb1))

#' The difference is now a bit smaller, but still the difference is
#' huge. The column `diag_elpd` is reminding us that there were high
#' Pareto k values in PSIS-LOO computation. This illustrates that we
#' don't always need to improve PSIS-LOO computation to get rid of all
#' high Pareto-$\hat{k}$'s, if the difference between the models is
#' clearly bigger than possible bias.
#'
#' 
#' As Poisson is a special case of negative-Binomial, instead of using
#' cross validation model comparison, we could have also seen that
#' Poisson is not a good model by looking at the posterior of the
#' over-dispersion parameter (which gets very small values), and there
#' would not have been a need to fit the Poisson model at all.
#| label: fig-posterior-nb_dispersion

#| fig-width: 6
mcmc_areas(fit_nb, pars = "shape", prob_outer = 0.999)

#' Posterior predictive rootogram and LOO-PIT-ECDF looked good, but
#' for discrete models where some discrete values have relatively high
#' probability it may miss things and it is good to examine more
#' carefully how well calibrated predictive probabilities are. In
#' roaches, 64% of observations are 0, and it makes sense to look how
#' well we predict zeros or non-zeros. To check calibration of binary
#' target predictive probabilities, we use PAV-adjusted reliability
#' diagram [@Dimitriadis-Gneiting-Jordan:2021,@Sailynoja-Johnson-Martin-etal:2025].
#' Although in this case, the difference is small, for demonstration
#' we use LOO predictive probabilities instead of posterior predictive
#' probabilities for non-zeros. In case of good calibration, the
#' calibration line would stay mostly inside of the envelope.

#' There is a slight miscalibration indicated by red curve being quite
#' much outside of the blue envelope. We later build a zero-inflated
#' model to test whether that would improve calibration and predictive
#' performance.
#'
#' # Poisson model with varying intercepts
#' 
#' Sometimes overdispersion is modelled by adding varying intercepts
#' ("random effects") for each individual. Negative-binomial model can
#' be considered as mixture of Poissons with mixing distribution being
#' a gamma distribution. It is common to use normal prior for varying
#' intercepts in log intensity scale. This kind of varying intercept
#' model may fit the data better than negative binomial model for two
#' reasons. First, it is possible that the normal variation in log
#' intensity scale is closer to actual variation. Second, explicitly
#' presenting the latent values and using a prior makes the model
#' slightly more flexible as the posterior of the varying intercepts
#' can be different from the prior. However, in this case with just
#' one observation per varying intercept, it is likely that the
#' posterior is close to normal as likelihood contribution from one
#' observation for each varying intercept is weak.
#' The following example demonstrates computational challenges with
#' varying intercept approach.
#'
#' We add varying intercept for each observation with normal prior
#' using the formula term `(1 | id)`.  We use run the sampling four times
#' longer to get high enough effective sample sizes.

fit_pvi <- add_criterion(fit_pvi, criterion = "loo")

#' `p_loo` is about 164, which is less than the number of parameters
#' 267, but it is relatively large compared to the number of
#' observations (`p_loo >>N/5`), which indicates very flexible
#' model. In this case, this is due to having an intercept parameter for
#' each observation. Removing one observation changes the posterior
#' for that intercept so much that importance sampling fails (even
#' with Pareto smoothing).  Also the very large number of high $k$
#' values is probably due to having very flexible model.
#' We can try to improve computation with moment matching.

#' likely to not be able to help enough as the posterior of the group
#' specific parameter is changing too much and moment matching for
#' high dimensional non-normal posterior is not able to help
#' enough. `brms` supports running MCMC for the LOO folds with high
#' Pareto-$\hat{k}$'s with `reloo = TRUE`, but that would in this case
#' require 46 refits.  We can use $K$-fold-CV instead to re-fit the

#' # Poisson model with varying intercept and integrated LOO
#' 
#' Removing one observation changes the posterior for that intercept
#' so much that importance sampling fails (even with Pareto
#' smoothing). We can get improved stability by integrating that
#' intercept out with something more accurate than the importance
#' sampling [@Vehtari+etal:2016:LOO_for_GLVM].  If there is only one
#' group or individual specific parameter then we can integrate that
#' out easily with 1D adaptive quadrature. 2 parameters can be handled
#' with nested 1D quadratures, but for more parameters nested
#' quadrature is likely to be too slow and other integration methods
#' are needed.
#'
#' As we can easily integrate out only 1 (or 2) parameters (per group
#' / individual), it's not easy to make a generic approach for `rstanarm`
#' and `brms`, and thus we illustrate the approach with direct Stan model
#' code and `cmdstanr`.
#' 
#' The following Stan model uses individual specific intercept term
#' `z[i]` (with common prior with scale `sigmaz`). In the generated
#' quantities, the usual `log_lik` computation is replaced with
#' integrated approach. We also generate `y_loorep` which is the LOO
#' predictive distribution given other parameters than `z`. This is
#' needed to get the correct LOO predictive distributions when
#' combined with integrated PSIS-LOO.

#' We could also move the integrated likelihood to the model block and
#' not use MCMC to sample the varying intercepts at all. This would
#' make marginal posterior easier for MCMC, but using quadrature
#' integration $N$ times for each leapfrog step in Hamiltonian Monte
#' Carlo sampling will increase the sampling time more than what would
#' be the benefit from the simpler marginal posterior. When we do the
#' integration in the generated quantities, the quadrature is computed
#' only for each saved iteration making the computation faster.
#' 
#' Next we compile the model, prepare the data, and sample. `integrate_1d_reltol`
#' sets the relative tolerance for the adaptive 1D quadrature function
#' `integrate_1d` (if with other model and data you see messages about
#' error estimate of integral exceeding the given relative tolerance
#' times norm of integral, you will get NaNs and need to increase the
#' relative tolerance).
#'
#' We increase the number of sampling iterations to improve effective
#' sample size needed for better LOO-PIT plot.

#' Treatment effect improves the predictive performance with 96%
#' probability. However, as the distribution of the pointwise
#' differences seem to have a thick tail, the estimated probability
#' using the normal approximation can be sensitive to a few biggest
#' pointwise differences, which are due to the a few biggest numbers
#' of roaches observed. Interestingly in this case, both models pass
#' model checking, seem to be well specified, the distributions of
#' pointwise elpds do not have thick tails, and we are able to
#' reliably estimate `elpd_loo` for each model. This indicates that
#' `elpd_diff` is likely to be well estimated, but the distribution of
#' pointwise differences having thicker tail make `se_diff` and the
#' normal approximation based `p_worse` unreliable. The conclusion is
#' that the full model has slightly better predictive performance.
#'
#' As the variation in the number of roaches is high in both treatment
#' groups, it is difficult to predict the number of roaches per
#' apartment making the difference in predictive performance also
#' small, even we can clearly see clear difference in the expected
#' number of roaches in the groups.
