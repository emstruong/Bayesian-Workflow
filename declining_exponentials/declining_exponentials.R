#' # Declining exponential
#' 
#' Let's fit the following simple model: $y = ae^{-bx} + \mathrm{error}$,
#' given data $(x,y)_i$:
#' $$
#' y_i = ae^{-bx_i} + \epsilon_i, \text{ for } i=1,\dots,N,
#' $$
#' We shall assume the errors are independent and normally
#' distributed: $\epsilon_i \sim \operatorname{normal}(0,\sigma)$.
#' 
#' Here is the model in Stan:
#| results: asis
print_stan_file(root("declining_exponentials",  "exponential.stan"))

#' We have given the parameters $a$, and $b$, and $\sigma$ normal
#' prior distributions centered at 0 with standard deviation 10.  In
#' addition, the parameter $\sigma$ is constrained to be positive.
#' The purpose of the prior distributions is to keep the computations
#' at a reasonable value.  If we were working on a problem in which we
#' thought that $a$, $b$, or $\sigma$ could be much greater than 10,
#' we would want to use a weaker prior distribution.
#'
#' Another point about the above Stan program: the model for $y$ is
#' vectorized and could instead have been written more explicitly as a
#' loop:
#' ```stan
#' for (i in 1:N) {
#'   y[i] ~ normal(a*exp(-b*x[i]), sigma);
#' }
#' ```
#' We prefer the vectorized version as it is more compact and it also
#' runs faster in Stan, for reasons discussed elsewhere in this book.
#'
#' ## Simulated data
#' 
#' To demonstrate our exponential model, we fit it to fake data.
#' We'll simulate $N=100$ data points with predictors $x$ uniformly
#' distributed between 0 and 10, from the above model with $a=0.2$,
#' $b=0.3$, $\sigma=0.5$.
a <- 5
b <- 0.3
sigma <- 0.5
N <- 100
x <- runif(N, 0, 10)
y <- rnorm(N, a * exp(-b * x), sigma)

#' Here is a graph of the true curve and the simulated data:
#| label: fig-true-and-simulated
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
curve(a * exp(-b * x), from = 0, to = 10, ylim = range(x, y), 
      xlab = "x", ylab = "y", bty = "l", 
      main = "Data and true model", cex.main = 1)
points(x, y, pch = 20, cex = 0.2)

#' And then we fit the model:

#| results: hide
#| label: fit_1
data_1 <- list(N = N, x = x, y = y)
mod_1 <- cmdstan_model(root("declining_exponentials", "exponential.stan"))
fit_1 <- mod_1$sample(data = data_1)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_1)

#' Recall that the true parameter values were $a=5.0$, $b=0.3$,
#' $\sigma=0.5$. Here the model is simple enough and the data are
#' clean enough that we can estimate all three of these parameters
#' with reasonable precision from the data, as can be seen from the
#' 95% intervals above.
#'
#' Alternatively, we might want to say ahead of time that we are
#' fitting a declining exponential curve that starts positive and
#' descends to zero. We would thus want to constrain the parameters
#' $a$ and $b$ to be positive, which we can do in the parameters
#' block:
#' ```stan
#'   real<lower=0> a;
#'   real<lower=0> b;
#' ```
#' Otherwise we leave the model unchanged.  In this case the results
#' turn out to be very similar:
#| label: fit_1b
#| results: hide
mod_1b <- cmdstan_model(root("declining_exponentials","exponential_positive.stan"))
fit_1b <- mod_1b$sample(data = data_1)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_1b)

#' ## Small simulated data
#' 
#' With weaker data, though, the constraints could make a difference.
#' We could experiment on this by doing the same simulation but with
#' just $N=10$ data points:
N <- 10
x <- runif(N, 0, 10)
y <- rnorm(N, a * exp(-b * x), sigma)
#| label: fig-10-data-points
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
curve(a * exp(-b * x), from = 0, to = 10, ylim = range(x, y),
      xlab = "x", ylab = "y", bty = "l", 
      main = "Just 10 data points", cex.main = 1)
points(x, y, pch = 20, cex = 0.2)

#' First we fit the unconstrained model:
#| results: hide
#| label: fit_2
data_2 <- list(N = N, x = x, y = y)
fit_2 <- mod_1$sample(data = data_2)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_2)

#' Then we fit the constrained model:
#| results: hide
#| label: fit_2b
fit_2b <- mod_1b$sample(data = data_2)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_2b)

#' Different things can happen with different sets of simulated data,
#' but the inference with the positivity constraints will typically be
#' much more stable.  Of course, we would only want to constrain the
#' model in this way if we knew that the positivity restriction is
#' appropriate.
#'
#' ## Positive simulated data
#' 
#' Now suppose that the data are also restricted to be positive.  Then
#' we need a different error distribution, as the above model with
#' additive normal errors can yield negative data.
#'
#' Let's try a multiplicative error, with a lognormal distribution:
#' $$
#' y_i = ae^{-bx_i} * \epsilon_i, \text{ for } i=1,\dots,N\\
#' \log\epsilon_i \sim \operatorname{normal}(0,\sigma), \text{ for } i=1,\dots,N
#' $$
#' 
#' Here is the model in Stan:
#| results: asis
print_stan_file(root("declining_exponentials", "exponential_positive_lognormal.stan"))

#' As before, we can simulate fake data from this model:
a <- 5
b <- 0.3
sigma <- 0.5
N <- 100
x <- runif(N, 0, 10)
epsilon <- exp(rnorm(N, 0, sigma))
y <- a * exp(-b * x) * epsilon
#| label: fig-positive-true-and-simulated
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
curve(a * exp(-b * x), from = 0, to = 10, ylim = range(x, y), 
      xlab = "x", ylab = "y", bty = "l", 
      main = "Data and true model", cex.main = 1)
points(x, y, pch = 20, cex = 0.2)

#' We can then fit the model to the simulated data and check that the
#' parameters are approximately recovered:
#| results: hide
#| label: fit_3
data_3 <- list(N = N, x = x, y = y)
mod_3 <- cmdstan_model(root("declining_exponentials", "exponential_positive_lognormal.stan"))
fit_3 <- mod_3$sample(data = data_3)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_3)

#' # Sum of declining exponentials
#'
#' From the numerical analysis literature, here is an example of an
#' inference problem that appears simple but can be surprisingly
#' difficult.  The challenge is to estimate the parameters of a sum of
#' declining exponentials: $y = a_1e^{-b_1x} + a_2e^{-b_2x}$.  This is
#' also called an inverse problem, and it can be challenging to
#' decompose these two declining functions.
#'
#' This expression, and others like it, arise in many examples,
#' including in pharmacology, where $x$ represents time and $y$ could
#' be the concentration of a drug in the blood of someone who was
#' given a specified dose at time 0.  In a simple _two-compartment
#' model_, the total concentration will look like a sum of declining
#' exponentials.
#' 
#' To set this up as a statistics problem, we add some noise to the
#' system.  We want the data to always be positive so our noise will be
#' multiplicative:
#' $$
#' y_i = (a_1e^{-b_1x_i} + a_2e^{-b_2x_i}) * \epsilon_i, \text{ for } i=1,\dots,N,
#' $$
#' with lognormally-distributed errors $\epsilon$.
#' 
#' Here is the model in Stan:
#| results: asis
print_stan_file(root("declining_exponentials", "sum_of_exponentials.stan"))

#' The coefficients $a$ and the residual standard deviation $\sigma$
#' are constrained to be positive.  The parameters $b$ are also
#' positive---these are supposed to be declining, not increasing,
#' exponentials---and are also constrained to be ordered, so that
#' $b_1<b_2$.  We need this to keep the model _identified_: Without
#' some sort of restriction, there would be no way from the data to
#' tell which component is labeled 1 and which is 2.  So we
#' arbitrarily label the component with lower value of $b$---that is,
#' the one that declines more slowly---as the first one, and the
#' component with higher value of $b$ to be the second.  We added the
#' `positive_ordered` type to Stan because this sort of identification
#' problem comes up fairly often in applications.
#' 
#' We'll try out our Stan model by simulating fake data from a model
#' where the two curves should be cleanly distinguished, setting
#' $b_1=0.1$ and $b_2=2.0$, a factor of 20 apart in scale.  We'll
#' simulate 1000 data points where the predictors $x$ are uniformly
#' spaced from 0 to 10, and, somewhat arbitrarily, set $a_1=1.0$,
#' $a_2=0.8$, and $\sigma=0.2$.  We can then simulate from the
#' lognormal distribution to generate the data $y$.
a <- c(1, 0.8)
b <- c(0.1, 2)
N <- 1000
x <- seq(0, 10, length = N)
sigma <- 0.2
epsilon <- exp(rnorm(N, 0, sigma))
y <- (a[1] * exp(-b[1] * x) + a[2] * exp(-b[2] * x)) * epsilon

#' Here is a graph of the true curve and the simulated data:
#| label: fig-sumexp-true-and-simulated
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
data_graph <- function(a, b, sigma, x, y) {
  curve(a[1] * exp(-b[1] * x) + a[2] * exp(-b[2] * x), 
        from = min(x), to = max(x), 
        ylim = c(0, 1.05 * max(y)),  xlim = c(0, max(x)), 
        xlab = "x", ylab = "y", xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", bty = "l", 
        main = "Data and true model", cex.main = 1)
  points(x, y, pch = 20, cex = 0.2)
  text(max(x), 0.5 * max(y), 
       paste("y = ", fround(a[1], 1), "*exp(", fround(-b[1], 1), "*x) + ",  
             fround(a[2], 1), "*exp(", fround(-b[2], 1), "*x)", sep = ""), adj = 1)
}
data_graph(a, b, sigma, x, y)

#' And then we fit the model:
#| results: hide
#| label: fit_4
data_4 <- list(N = N, x = x, y = y)
mod_4 <- cmdstan_model(root("declining_exponentials", "sum_of_exponentials.stan"))
fit_4 <- mod_4$sample(data = data_4)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_4)

#' The parameters are recovered well, with the only difficulty being
#' $b_2$, where the estimate is 1.89 but the true value is 2.0---but
#' that is well within the posterior uncertainty.  Stan worked just
#' fine on this nonlinear model.
#'
#' But now let's make the problem just slightly more difficult.
#' Instead of setting the two parameters $b$ to 0.1 and 2.0, we'll
#' make them 0.1 and 0.2, so now only a factor of 2 separates the
#' scales of the two declining exponentials.
b <- c(0.1, 0.2)
y_2 <- (a[1] * exp(-b[1] * x) + a[2] * exp(-b[2] * x)) * epsilon
data_5 <- list(N = N, x = x, y = y_2)

#' This should still be easy to fit in Stan, right?  Wrong:
#| results: hide
#| label: fit_5
fit_5 <- mod_4$sample(data = data_5)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_5)

#' What happened??  It turns out that these two declining exponentials
#' are _very_ hard to detect.  Look: here's a graph of the
#' two-component model for the expected data,
#' $y=1.0e^{-0.1x}+0.8e^{-0.2x}$:
#| label: fig-sumexp-true-model
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
curve(a[1] * exp(-b[1] * x) + a[2] * exp(-b[2] * x), 
      from = 0, to = 10, ylim = c(0, 1.9), xlim = c(0, 10), 
      xlab = "x", ylab = "y", xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", bty = "l", 
      main = "True model", cex.main = 1)
text(5.6, 0.7, "y = 1.0*exp(-0.1x) + 0.8*exp(-0.2x)", adj = 1)

#' And now we'll overlay a graph of a particular _one-component_ model,
#' $y=1.8e^{-0.135x}$:
#| label: fig-sumexp-true-and-one-component
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
curve(a[1] * exp(-b[1] * x) + a[2] * exp(-b[2] * x), from = 0, to = 10, 
      ylim = c(0, 1.9), xlim = c(0, 10), 
      xlab = "x", ylab = "y", xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", bty = "l", 
      main = "True model and scarily-close one-component approximation", cex.main = 1)
curve(1.8 * exp(-0.135 * x), from = 0, to = 10, add = TRUE)
text(5.6, 0.7, "y = 1.0*exp(-0.1x) + 0.8*exp(-0.2x)", adj = 1)
text(6.1, 1.3, "y = 1.8*exp(-0.135x)", adj = 1)

#' The two lines are strikingly close, and it would be essentially
#' impossible to tell them apart based on noisy data, even 1000
#' measurements. So Stan had trouble recovering the true parameters
#' from the data.
#'
#' Still, if the parameters are difficult to fit, this should just
#' result in a high posterior uncertainty.  Why did the Stan fit
#' explode?  The problem in this case is that, since only one term in
#' the model was required to fit these data, the second term was
#' completely free---and the parameter $\beta_2$ was unbounded: there
#' was nothing stopping it from being estimated as arbitrarily large.
#' This sort of unbounded posterior distribution is called _improper_
#' (see Bayesian Data Analysis for a more formal definition), and
#' there is no way of drawing simulations from such a distribution,
#' hence Stan does not converge. The simulations drift off to
#' infinity, as there is nothing in the prior or likelihood that is
#' keeping them from doing so.
#'
#' To fix the problem, we can add some prior information.  Here we
#' shall use our default, which is independent $\operatorname{normal}(0,1)$
#' prior densities on all the parameters; thus, we add these lines to
#' the model block in the Stan program:
#' ```stan
#'   a ~ normal(0, 1);
#'   b ~ normal(0, 1);
#'   sigma ~ normal(0, 1);
#' ```
#' 
#' For this particular example, all we really need is a prior on $b$
#' (really, just $b_2$ because of the ordering), but to demonstrate
#' the point we shall assign default priors to everything.  The priors
#' are in addition to the rest of the model; that is, they go on top
#' of the positivity and ordering constraints.  So, for example, the
#' prior for $\sigma$ is the positive half of a normal, which is
#' sometimes written as $\operatorname{normal}^+(0,1)$.
#'
#' We now can fit this new model to our data, and the results are much
#' more stable:
#| label: fit_5_with_priors
#| results: hide
mod_5_with_priors <- cmdstan_model(root("declining_exponentials", "sum_of_exponentials_with_priors.stan"))
fit_5_with_priors <- mod_5_with_priors$sample(data = data_5)

#' Posterior summary:
print(fit_5_with_priors)

#' The fit is far from perfect---compare to the true parameter values,
#' $a_1=1.0$, $a_2=0.8$, $b_1=0.1$, $b_2=0.2$---but we have to expect
#' that.  As explained above, the data at hand do not identify the
#' parameters, so all we can hope for in a posterior distribution is
#' some summary of uncertainty.
#'
#' The question then arises, what about those prior distributions?  We
#' can think about them in a couple different ways.
#'
#' From one direction, we can think of scaling.  We are using priors
#' centered at 0 with a scale of 1; this can be reasonable if the
#' parameters are on "unit scale," meaning that we expect them to be
#' of order of magnitude around 1.  Not all statistical models are on
#' unit scale.  For example, in the above model, if the data $y_i$ are
#' on unit scale, but the data values $x_i$ take on values in the
#' millions, then we'd probably expect the parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$
#' to be roughly on the scale of $10^{-6}$.  In such a case, we'd want
#' to rescale $x$ so that the coefficients $b$ are more interpretable.
#' Similarly, if the values of $y$ ranged in the millions, then the
#' coefficients $a$ would have to be of order $10^6$, and, again, we
#' would want to rescale the data or the model so that $a$ would be on
#' unit scale.  By using unit scale priors, we are implicitly assuming
#' the model has been scaled.
#'
#' From the other direction, instead of adapting the model to the
#' prior distribution, we could adapt the prior to the model.  That
#' would imply an understanding of a reasonable range of values for
#' the parameters, based on the context of the problem.  In any
#' particular example this could be done by simulating parameter
#' vectors from the prior distribution and graphing the corresponding
#' curves of expected data, and seeing if these could plausibly cover
#' the possible cases that might arise in the particular problem being
#' studied.
#'
#' No matter how it's done, inference has to come from somewhere, and
#' if the data are weak, you need to put in prior information if your
#' goal is to make some statement about possible parameter values, and
#' from there to make probabilistic predictions and decisions.
