#' # Improper posterior
#'
#' An unbounded likelihood without a proper prior can lead to an
#' improper posterior. We recommend to always use proper priors
#' (integral over a proper distribution is finite) to guarantee proper
#' posteriors.
#'
#' A commonly used model that can have unbounded likelihood is
#' logistic regression with complete separation in data.
#'
#' ## Data
#'
#' Univariate continous predictor $x$, binary target $y$, and the two
#' classes are completely separable, which leads to unbounded
#' likelihood.

#' ## Model
#'
#' We use the following Stan logistic regression model, where we have
#' ``forgot'' to include prior for the coefficient `beta`.

fit_logit <- mod_logit$sample(data = data_logit, seed = SEED, refresh = 0)

#'
#' ## Convergence diagnostics
#'
#' When running Stan, we get warnings. We can also
#' explicitly check the inference diagnostics:
fit_logit$diagnostic_summary()

#' We can also check $\widehat{R}$ end effective sample size (ESS) diagnostics
#' [@Vehtari-Gelman-Simpson-etal:2021]
draws <- as_draws_rvars(fit_logit$draws())
summarize_draws(draws)

#' We see that $\widehat{R}$ for both \texttt{alpha} and \texttt{beta}
#' are about 3 and Bulk-ESS is about 4, which indicate that the chains
#' are not mixing at all.
#'
#' The above diagnostics refer to a documentation
#' ([https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings](https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings))
#' that mentions possibility to adjust the sampling algorithm options
#' (e.g., increasing `adapt_delta` and `max_treedepth`), but it is
#' better first to investigate the posterior.
#'
#' The following Figure shows the posterior draws as marginal
#' histograms and joint scatterplots. The range of the values is huge,
#' which is typical for improper posterior, but the values of `alpha`
#' and `beta` in any practical application are likely to have much
#' smaller magnitude. In this case, increasing `adapt_delta` and
#' `max_treedepth` would not have solved the problem, and would have
#' just caused waste of modeler and computation time.

#'
#' ## Stan compiler pedantic check
#'
#' The above diagnostics are applicable with any probabilistic
#' programming framework.  Stan compiler can also recognize some
#' common problems. By default the pedantic mode is not enabled, but
#' we can use option `pedantic = TRUE` at compilation time, or after
#' compilation with the `check_syntax` method.

#' ## Convergence diagnostics

#' There were no convergence warnings. We can also

#'
#' # A model with unused parameter
#'
#' When writing and editing models, a common mistake is to declare a
#' parameter, but not use it in the model. If the parameter is not
#' used at all, it doesn't have proper prior and the likelihood
#' doesn't provide information about that parameter, and thus the
#' posterior along that parameter is improper. We use the previous
#' logistic regression model with proper priors on `alpha` and
#' `beta`, but include extra parameter declaration `real
#' gamma`.

#' There is sampler warning. We can also explicitly call inference

#' Instead of increasing `max_treedepth`, we check the other convergence diagnostics. 
draws <- as_draws_rvars(fit_logit3$draws())
summarize_draws(draws)

#' $\widehat{R}$, Bulk-ESS, and Tail-ESS look good for `alpha` and
#' `beta, but really bad for `gamma`, clearly pointing where to look
#' for problems in the model code. The histogram of `gamma` posterior
#' draws show huge magnitude of values (values larger than $10^{20}$)
#' indicating improper posterior.

#'
#' # A posterior with two parameters competing
#'
#' Sometimes the models have two or more parameters that have similar
#' or exactly the same role. We illustrate this by adding an extra
#' column to the previous data matrix. Sometimes the data matrix is
#' augmented with a column of 1’s to present the intercept effect. In
#' this case that is redundant as our model has the explicit intercept
#' term `alpha`, and this redundancy will lead to problems.

#' The Stan sampling time per chain with the original data matrix was
#' less than 0.1s per chain. Now the Stan sampling time per chain is
#' several seconds, which is suspicious. There are no automatic
#' convergence diagnostic warnings and checking other diagnostics
#' don't show anything really bad.

#' ESS estimates are above the recommended diagnostic thresholds
#' [@Vehtari-Gelman-Simpson-etal:2021], but
#' lower than what we would expect in general from Stan for such a
#' lower dimensional problem.
#'
#' The following figure shows marginal histograms and joint
#' scatterplots, and we can see that `alpha` and `beta[1]` are highly
#' correlated.

#' We can compute the correlation.
cor(as_draws_matrix(draws)[, c("alpha", "beta[1]")])[1, 2]

#' The numerical value for the correlation is $-0.999$. The
#' correlation close to 1 can happen also from other reasons (see the
#' next example), but one possibility is that parameters have similar
#' role in the model. Here the reason is the constant column in $x$,
#' which we put there for the demonstration purposes. We may a have
#' constant column, for example, if the predictor matrix is augmented
#' with the intercept predictor, or if the observed data or subdata
#' used in the specific analysis happens to have only one unique
#' value.
#'
#' ## Stan compiler pedantic check
#'
#' Stan compiler pedantic check examining the code can’t
#' recognize this issue, as the problem depends also on the data.

#'
#' # A posterior with very high correlation
#'
#' In the previous example the two parameters had the same role in the
#' model, leading to high posterior correlation. High posterior
#' correlations are common also in linear models when the predictor
#' values are far from 0. We illustrate this with a linear regression
#' model for the summer temperature in Kilpisjärvi, Finland,
#' 1952--2013. We use the year as the covariate $x$ without centering
#' it.
#'
#' ## Data

#' The data are Kilpisjärvi summer month temperatures 1952-2013
#' measured by Finnish Meteorological Institute.

#' are no other warnings.

draws <- as_draws_rvars(fit_lin$draws())
summarize_draws(draws)

#' ESS estimates are above the diagnostic threshold, but lower than we
#' would expect for such a low dimensional model, unless there are
#' strong posterior correlations. The following Figure shows the
#' marginal histograms and joint scatterplot for `alpha` and
#' `beta[1]`, which shows they are very highly correlated.

mcmc_pairs(as_draws_array(draws), pars = c("alpha", "beta"),
           off_diag_args = list(alpha = 0.2))

#' Here the reason is that the $x$ values are in the range 1952--2013,
#' and the intercept `alpha` denotes the temperature at year 0, which
#' is very far away from the range of observed $x$. If the intercept
#' `alpha` changes, the slope `beta` needs to change too. The high
#' correlation makes the inference slower, and we can make it faster
#' by centering $x$. Here we simply subtract 1982.5 from the predictor
#' `year`, so that the mean of $x$ is 0. We could also include the
#' centering and back transformation to Stan code.
#'
#' ## Centered data
#'
data_lin <- list(
  M = 1,
  N = nrow(data_kilpis),
  x = matrix(data_kilpis$year - 1982.5, ncol = 1),

mcmc_pairs(as_draws_array(draws), pars = c("alpha", "beta"),
           off_diag_args = list(alpha = 0.2))

#'
#' With this change, there is no posterior correlation, Bulk-ESS
#' estimates are 3 times bigger, and the mean time per chain goes from
#' 1.3s to less than 0.05s; that is, we get 2 orders of magnitude
#' faster inference. In a bigger problems this could correspond to
#' reduction of computation time from 24 hours to less than 20
#' minutes.

#'
#' # A bimodal posterior
#'
#' Bimodal distributions can arise from many reasons as in mixture
#' models or models with non-log-concave likelihoods or priors (that
#' is, with distributions with thick tails). We illustrate the
#' diagnostics revealing the multimodal posterior. We use a simple toy
#' problem with $t$ model and data that is not from a $t$
#' distribution, but from a mixture of two normal distributions
#'
#' ## Data
#'
#' Bimodally distributed data
N <- 20
y <- c(rnorm(N / 2, mean = -5, sd = 1), rnorm(N / 2, mean = 5, sd = 1))

#' The $\widehat{R}$ values for `mu` are large and ESS values for `mu`
#' are small indicating convergence problems. The following figure
#' shows the histogram and trace plots of the posterior draws, clearly
#' showing the bimodality and that chains are not mixing between the
#' modes.

mcmc_hist(as_draws_array(draws), pars = c("mu"))

#' In this toy example, with random initialization each chains has
#' 50\% probability of ending in either mode. We used Stan's default
#' of 4 chains, and when random initialization is used, there is 6\%
#' chance that when running Stan once, we would miss the
#' multimodality. If the attraction areas within the random
#' initialization range are not equal, the probability of missing one
#' mode is even higher. There is a tradeoff between the default
#' computation cost and cost of having higher probability of finding
#' multiple modes. If there is a reason to suspect multimodality, it
#' is useful to run more chains. Running more chains helps to diagnose
#' the multimodality, but the probability of chains ending in
#' different modes can be different from the relative probability mass
#' of each mode, and running more chains doesn't fix this. Other means
#' are needed to improve mixing between the modes (e.g. Yao et al.,
#' 2020) or to approximately weight the chains (e.g. Yao et al.,
#' 2022).

#' separated, MCMC can jump from one mode to another and there are no

#' # Initial value issues
#'
#' MCMC requires some initial values. By default, Stan generates them
#' randomly from [-2,2] in unconstrained space (constraints on
#' parameters are achieved by transformations). Sometimes these
#' initial values can be bad and cause numerical issues. Computers,
#' (in general) use finite number of bits to present numbers and with
#' very small or large numbers, there can be problems of presenting
#' them or there can be significant loss of accuracy.
#'
#' The data is generated from a Poisson regression model. The Poisson
#' intensity parameter has to be positive and usually the latent
#' linear predictor is exponentiated to be positive (the
#' exponentiation can also be justified by multiplicative effects on
#' Poisson intensity).
#'
#' We intentionally generate the data so that there are initialization
#' problems, but the same problem is common with real data when the
#' scale of the predictors is large or small compared to the unit
#' scale. The following figure shows the simulated data.
#'

#' efficiency.

mcmc_pairs(as_draws_array(draws), pars = c("alpha", "beta"),

#' The reason for the issue is that the initial values for
#' `beta` are sampled from $(-2, 2)$ and `x` has some
#' large values. If the initial value for `beta` is higher than
#' about 0.3 or lower than $-0.4$, some of the values of
#' `exp(alpha + beta * x)` will overflow to floating point
#' infinity (`Inf`). 
#'
#' ## Scaled data
#'
#' Sometimes an easy option is to change the initialization range. For
#' example, in this the sampling succeeds if the initial values are
#' drawn from the range $(-0.001, 0.001)$. Alternatively we can scale
#' `x` to have scale close to unit scale. After this scaling, the
#' computation is fast and all convergence diagnostics look good.

#' # Funnel
#'
#' A special case of varying curvature is known as the funnel, based
#' on the shape of the typical set of the distribution. Consider a
#' hierarchical model, $y_i\sim\normal(\mu_{k[i]},\sigma)$ for
#' $i=1,\dots,N$ and group membership variable $k[i]$ which takes on
#' values from 1 through $K$.  We shall assume the prior distribution,
#' $\mu_k\sim\normal(\mu_0,\sigma_0),j=1,\dots,J$.  When plotted on
#' the scale $\mu_1,\dots,\mu_K, \log\sigma_0$, this prior can be
#' visualized as a having shape of a funnel
#'
#' If the funnel-shaped prior is combined with a weak likelihood, the
#' posterior is also funnel shaped. As a toy example, we use the
#' Kilpisjärvi temperature data, with each group being one year, with
#' three summer month temperatures per year. With only three
#' observations per group, the likelihood is weak for each $\mu_k$ and
#' the prior is likely to dominate the posterior shape. The number of
#' groups is 71, and this high dimensionality makes the funnel
#' challenging.

#'
#' ## Data
#'
#' We simulated x and y independently from independently from
#' normal(0,1) and normal(0,0.1) respectively. As $N=8$ is small,
#' there will be a lot of uncertainty about the parameters including
#' the scale sigma.

#' We get many times the following warnings

#' Chain 4 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
#' Chain 4 Exception: normal_id_glm_lpdf: Scale vector is -0.747476, but must be positive finite! (in '/tmp/RtmprEP4gg/model-7caa12ce8e405.stan', line 16, column 2 to column 43)
#' Chain 4 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
#' Chain 4 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
#'```
#'
#' Sometimes these warnings appear in early phase of the sampling,
#' even if the model has been correctly defined. Now we have too many
#' of them, which indicates the samples is trying to jump to
#' infeasible values, which here means the negative scale parameter
#' values. Many rejections may lead to biased estimates.
#'
#' There are some divergences reported, which is also indication that
#' there might be some problem (as divergence diagnostic has an ad hoc
#' diagnostic threshold, there can also be false positive
#' warnings). Other convergence diagnostics are good, but due to many
#' rejection warnings, it is good to check the model code and
#' numerical accuracy of the computations.
